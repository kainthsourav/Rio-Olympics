				<b></p><br><br><br><p><b>BOXING HAS BEEN CONTESTED AT EVERY SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION TO 
				THE PROGRAM AT THE 1904 SUMMER OLYMPICS, EXCEPT FOR THE 1912 SUMMER OLYMPICS IN STOCKHOLM, BECAUSE SWEDISH 
				LAW BANNED THE SPORT AT THE TIME. THE 2008 SUMMER OLYMPICS WERE THE FINAL GAMES WITH BOXING AS A MALE ONLY 
				EVENT. SINCE THE 2012 SUMMER OLYMPICS, WOMEN'S BOXING IS PART OF THE PROGRAM.THE BOXING COMPETITION IS 
				ORGANIZED AS A SET OF TOURNAMENTS, ONE FOR EACH WEIGHT CLASS. THE NUMBER OF WEIGHT CLASSES HAS CHANGED 
				OVER THE YEARS (CURRENTLY 10 FOR MEN AND 3 FOR WOMEN), AND THE DEFINITION OF EACH CLASS HAS CHANGED 
				SEVERAL TIMES, AS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. UNTIL 1936, WEIGHTS WERE MEASURED IN POUNDS, AND FROM 
				1948 ONWARDS, WEIGHTS WERE MEASURED IN KILOGRAMS.FROM THE 2016 SUMMER OLYMPICS, MALE ATHLETES NO LONGER 
				HAVE TO WEAR PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR IN COMPETITION, DUE TO A RULING BY THE AIBA AND THE IOC THAT IT 
				CONTRIBUTES TO GREATER CONCUSSION RISK. FEMALE ATHLETES WILL CONTINUE TO WEAR THE HEADGEAR, DUE TO 
				"LACK OF DATA" ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IT ON WOMEN</b></p>
